Projection Descriptions:
2. Created an airline booking system using a linked list.
3. Used recursive and iteracy binary search to allow a user to input a street address and find its corresponding latitude/longitude values and vice versa.
4. Made a program that tested an HTML for correct tags using a stack.
5. Created and tested two sorting algorithms, "corn sort" and "high low sort", that were variations of bubble and selection sort.
6. Implemented a hash table and binary search tree that could store the address data from project three (replacing the vector).
